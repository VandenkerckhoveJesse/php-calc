 # php-calc
 #### Made by Jesse Vandenkerckhove
 This is a small project to refresh my php and javascript.
I also used test-driven development using the PHPunit framework.

The backend exists of a simple api, the frontend connects to this api. All the calculations are done in the backend through the api.

Some notes: The calculator itself is not very complex and does not support huge numbers, this can be fixed by using a plugin that supports the use of huge numbers. But this was out of the scope of this project.
